**JamiiHub** is a proposed digital platform that brings together individuals and organizations for East Africa. On this platform:

- **People Can Collaborate**: JamiiHub space where people can come together to work on common goals, make decisions together, and support projects that matter to them.

- **They Can Vote**: Members of this community can cast votes on various matters, such as which projects to fund or important decisions about the community. Inclusivity is key.

- **They Can Fund Projects**: Crowdfunding is a powerful tool for community development. Members can come together and financially support projects, whether it's for community development, events, innovation, or emergencies.
- **Payments Made Easy**: To make this possible, we have integrated Fonbnk, a secure payment system that seamlessly allows members to contribute funds conveniently using digital currencies like USDC.

- Blockchain Records Everything: All transactions, votes, and decisions are recorded securely on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

##  Features and Functionality

The Key is to build a financial and consensus DAO. To have an example here, we will consider small scale farmers(the system is open and generic nonetheless) that want to facilitate their initiatives and features like:

1. **Decentralized Governance**: Implementing a robust governance system that allows all members of the DAO, including small farmers, to have a say in decision-making processes. This is achieved through voting mechanisms using, Aragon, a robust blockchain system for building DAOs.

2. **Tokenization**: Issue tokens that represent ownership or membership in the DAO. These tokens can be used for voting, participation in profits, or as collateral for loans.

3. **Proposal Management**: Develop a system for submitting and managing proposals. Members should be able to propose projects, investments, or policy changes and vote on them.

4. **Funding Mechanisms**: Integrate crowdfunding features where members can contribute funds to projects or initiatives they support. Fonbnk's payment widget is used for the purpose to accept payments in stable coins.

5. **Transparent Record Keeping**: Ensure all transactions and decisions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and accountability.

6. **Identity Verification**: Implement a secure identity verification system to ensure that only eligible individuals or organizations can participate in the DAO.

7. **Smart Contracts**: Use smart contracts for automating various processes within the DAO, such as distributing profits, executing proposals, or managing loans.

## Future Scope

1. **Communication Tools**: Provide communication channels within the platform for members to discuss and collaborate on projects or decisions.

2. **Education and Training**: The proposed system aims to offer resources and training programs to help small farmers and other participants understand how the DAO works and how to make the most of it.

## Fonbnk key features:
1. Accepting Payments: You can use Fonbnk's Pay Widget to accept payments in stable coins from members who want to contribute to projects or initiatives within the DAO. This makes it easy for users to support the DAO financially.

2. Transaction Tracking: Fonbnk allows you to track transactions and order progress. You can leverage this feature to maintain transparent records of contributions and payments within the DAO.

3. Webhooks: Consider integrating Fonbnk with webhook functionality. Merchants can set up webhooks to track payments and other transaction-related events, providing real-time updates to users about the status of their contributions or payments.

4. Incentive Programs: You can create incentive programs within your DAO where members are rewarded with stable coins (USDC) for their contributions or active participation. Fonbnk can facilitate these reward payouts.

We believe this platform will empower and positively impact communities from learners, agriculture, sports, uprising music industry, and more to collaborate, make decisions, and access financial resources from a pool and push their initiatives. Join our changemakers collective, a digital space where Kenyan visionaries converge to vote on initiatives and drive positive change.

Resource Mobilization: Often, there are common needs or opportunities that require a collective effort to resource. Crowdfunding enables the pooling of resources from multiple individuals or organizations to tackle larger challenges effectively. This can include securing land for farming, purchasing equipment, or launching marketing campaigns to promote local products.

Event Funding: Events such as agricultural fairs, cultural festivals, or workshops are essential for community engagement and knowledge sharing. Crowdfunding can be used to cover event-related expenses, ensuring that these gatherings are accessible and beneficial to everyone in the community.

Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Crowdfunding can foster innovation and entrepreneurship within the community. It provides a platform for aspiring entrepreneurs, including small farmers, to raise capital for their innovative projects or startups. This, in turn, can lead to job creation and economic growth.

Emergency Relief: In times of crises, whether natural disasters or health emergencies, crowdfunding can quickly raise funds for emergency relief efforts. It allows communities to respond promptly to urgent needs, such as providing food, shelter, or medical assistance.

Environmental Initiatives: Many communities are increasingly focused on environmental sustainability. Crowdfunding can be used to finance eco-friendly projects like reforestation, clean energy installations, or waste management programs, benefiting both the environment and the community.

Now, regarding building a DAO on Aragon and integrating it with Fonbnk, let's explore how these two can be combined:

## Aragon Key features

1. Aragon provides a robust framework for building decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). We aim to create a DAO specifically designed for fundraising purposes within the community.

2. Members can use Aragon's governance features to propose and vote on crowdfunding campaigns, ensuring transparency and community involvement in financial decisions.


## Integration with Fonbnk:

Fonbnk's payment widget can be seamlessly integrated into your Aragon-based DAO for accepting contributions in stable coins like USDC.
Members can use Fonbnk's payment features to make secure and efficient contributions to crowdfunding campaigns directly through the DAO platform.
Benefits:

This integration ensures that funds collected through crowdfunding campaigns are handled securely and transparently within the DAO.
Aragon's governance tools can be used to manage the allocation of funds, track campaign progress, and make collective decisions on how the raised funds should be utilized.
Fonbnk's transaction tracking and webhooks can provide real-time updates on contributions and financial activity within the DAO, enhancing transparency and accountability.

The great thing about Web3 and Blockchain is cooperation. We thrive by cooperating mostly and unlike the traditional Cooporate or financial institutions, Web3 aims to bring transparency back to the power of its users. JamiiHub aims to live up to this, building an inclusive DAO. Aragon and Fonbnk are key to realizing this. We combine the benefits of decentralized governance with secure, custom, and efficient payment processing.
